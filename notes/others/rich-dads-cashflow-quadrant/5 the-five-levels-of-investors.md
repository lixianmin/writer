##### Investing is the key to financial freedom.

---

My pool dad often said, "Investing is risky."

My rich dad often said, "Being financially uneducated is risky."



Five things happen to people who invest poorly.

1. They work hard all their lives.
2. They worry about money all their lives.
3. The depend on others, such as family, a company pension, or the government, to take care of them.
4. The boundaries of their lives are defined by money.
5. They will not know what true freedom is.
